Development
-----------

### Bumping version

#### Preparation

Install
[bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version#installation).

#### Pre-release

Choose which version number category to bump following [semver
specification](http://semver.org/).

Test bumping version
```bash
bump2version --dry-run --verbose $CATEGORY
```

where `$CATEGORY` is the target version number category name, possible
values are `patch`/`minor`/`major`.

Bump version
```bash
bump2version --verbose $CATEGORY
```

This will set version to `major.minor.patch-alpha`. 

#### Release

Test bumping version
```bash
bump2version --dry-run --verbose release
```

Bump version
```bash
bump2version --verbose release
```

This will set version to `major.minor.patch`.

### Running tests

Install dependencies:
- with `CPython`
  ```bash
  python -m pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements-tests.txt
  ```
- with `PyPy`
  ```bash
  pypy -m pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements-tests.txt
  ```

Plain
```bash
pytest
```

Inside `Docker` container:
- with `CPython`
  ```bash
  docker-compose --file docker-compose.cpython.yml up
  ```
- with `PyPy`
  ```bash
  docker-compose --file docker-compose.pypy.yml up
  ```

`Bash` script (e.g. can be used in `Git` hooks):
- with `CPython`
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh cpython
  ```

- with `PyPy`
  ```bash
  ./run-tests.sh pypy
  ```

`PowerShell` script (e.g. can be used in `Git` hooks):
- with `CPython`
  ```powershell
  .\run-tests.ps1
  ```
  or
  ```powershell
  .\run-tests.ps1 cpython
  ```
- with `PyPy`
  ```powershell
  .\run-tests.ps1 pypy
  ```
